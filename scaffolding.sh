This script clones an existing template-repository and then mirrors all branches of this repository to another existing project remote-repository. WARNING! It will DELETE all content of the project's remote-repository including its history! 
Furthermore it locally creates a database and imports a template SQL-file into this database.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be sure to have a remote-repository for your project created.
2. Adjust the variables of this script within the source-code to fit your needs.
3. Start your MySQL-server and be sure to have proper settings for character-set and collation for new databases set. E.g. in 'my.cnf' set
   [mysqld]
   character-set-server=utf8
   collation-server=utf8_general_ci
4. Start GIT if it's not running already.
